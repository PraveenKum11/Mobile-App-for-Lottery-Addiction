# Mobile App for Lottery Addiction  

* **What the project is about?**  
A medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities.  

* **What our goal is in this project.**  

For the first version of the app, they want us to focus on the 6/49 lottery and build functions that enable users to answer questions like:
* What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?
* What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?
* What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?
* And much more.
